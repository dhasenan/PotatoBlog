<!--
  This template shows a blog post, but not a page.

  Posts and pages use the same data format, and if you don't have a specific template for pages,
  PotatoBlog will fall back to this template.

  This is not a full HTML doc; it's going to be put into the 'default.html' template as
  {{{mainContent}}}!
  So you don't need the <html> or <body> tags or anything like that.
-->

<article>
  <!-- We used h1 for the blog title, and we generally want to use higher number  -->
  <h2>{{post.title}}</h2>
  <div class="author">by {{post.author}} on {{post.date}}</div>

  <!--
    post.bodyHTML is the actual text of the post in HTML.
    Since that's got valid HTML in it, you need to use the triple curly brackets here.
    Otherwise you'll see all the HTML in the post instead of seeing formatted text and images!
  -->
  {{{post.bodyHTML}}}
</article>
<div class="tags">
  <!--
    tags is a list, so you can go through that list using {{#tags}}...{{/tags}}
    Anything between those two markers gets repeated for each tag in the list.
    The inside bit can access the variables on that given tag.
  -->
  {{#post.tags}}
    <a href="{{archiveURL}}">{{name}}</a>
  {{/post.tags}}
</div>
