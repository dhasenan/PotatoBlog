<!--
  This template shows a blog page, but not a post.

  Posts and pages use the same data format, and if you don't have a specific template for pages,
  PotatoBlog will fall back to the post.html template.

  This is not a full HTML doc; it's going to be put into the 'default.html' template as
  {{{mainContent}}}!
  So you don't need the <html> or <body> tags or anything like that.
-->

<article>
  <!-- We used h1 for the blog title, and we generally want to use higher number  -->
  <h2>{{page.title}}</h2>
  <!-- You can include the date here -->
  <div class="author">by {{page.author}} on {{page.date}}</div>

  <!--
    page.bodyHTML is the actual text of the page in HTML.
    Since that's got valid HTML in it, you need to use the triple curly brackets here.
    Otherwise you'll see all the HTML in the page instead of seeing formatted text and images!
  -->
  {{{page.bodyHTML}}}
</article>
<!--
  This template doesn't have the tags section because pages don't appear in tag archives (or date
  archives either). So while you *could* link to them, it's just not useful.
