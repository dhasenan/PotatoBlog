<!--
  This is the default page template. It's the basic scaffolding of all your pages.
  You'll need to be passingly familiar with HTML to edit these templates.
  https://htmlforpeople.com/ is a good tutorial!
  If you're using a search engine to look something up, MDN has the best technical information; just
  add MDN after your search term. Granted, that's aimed at dedicated computer touchers.

  <head>
    <!--
      Variables can be included by surrounding them in two curly brackets.
      Every template includes the 'blog' variable.
    -->
    <title>{{blog.title}}</title>
    <!--
      This is for feed readers. They're at least moderately popular in the indieweb space.

      siteRoot is where your website is hosted. Like if you're going to upload whatever PotatoBlog
      puts out to https://potatoes.neocities.org/blog, that's what siteRoot is. It's **highly**
      recommended that you use this so PotatoBlog's preview function works.

    <link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="{{siteRoot}}/atom.xml" />

    <!--
      This tells the browser to use a CSS stylesheet. CSS makes your pages look pretty.
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{siteRoot}}/main.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--
      The header is where you put stuff that goes at the top of each page.
      It's commonly going to have a very wide, not very tall image and the title of your blog.
    -->
    <header>
      <h1>{{blog.title}}</h1>
    </header>

    <!-- The nav element is for main site navigation stuff. These are some common elements. -->
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="{{siteRoot}}/index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="{{siteRoot}}/about.html">About Me</a></li>
        <li><a href="{{siteRoot}}/archive/index.html">Archive</a></li>
        <li><a href="{{siteRoot}}/archive/tags/index.html">Tags</a></li>
        <!-- People use 'RSS' as the generic term, even when it's an Atom feed. -->
        <li><a href="{{siteRoot}}/atom.xml">RSS Feed</a></li>
        <!-- If you're part of a webring, this is a good place to put it. -->
      </ul>

    <!--
      mainContent is a special variable for the default template. It contains the blog post, landing
      page content, archive content, whatever this page needs. If you don't include this, your
      website will be a bunch of near identical pages, which isn't fun for anyone.

      Since this content contains valid HTML, it needs triple curly brackets around it.
      That tells PotatoBlog that we don't need to take extra precautions around special symbols like
      '&' and '<' -- we're trusting it to be HTML formatted already.

    {{{mainContent}}}

      have any other things you need to do attribution for, this is a convenient place for it. -->
